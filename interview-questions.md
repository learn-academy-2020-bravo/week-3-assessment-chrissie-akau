# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is the ability to pinpoint the key value pair attribute and manipulate only that information.

  Researched answer: Object destructuring is a special way of assigning variables in JavaScript and allows you to take something like an array or object and unpack their values into individual variables.  



2. What are the three arguments that .map() and .filter() can accept?

  Your answer: .map() and .fitler() both take in value, index and array as arguments.

  Researched answer: Value, index, and array are the three arguments .map and .filter accept.



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint of an object and an object contains a bunch of key:value pairs and is the cross section of behavior and data.

  Researched answer: Objects are variables that contain a collection of key:value pairs and are the cross section of data and behavior (methods).  Classes are the blueprints of objects.  They are reusable and customizable, much like functions.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: An HTML div is used to contain a larger area compared to an HTML span, which genrally used on smaller portions of HTML.  

  Researched answer: A span is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML insside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div element is block-line and used to group larger chunks of code.  



5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: React.Fragment is used in the return of a React component to organize the children components of the parent.

  Researched answer: A React.Fragment allows you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: Flexibility of the inteface is important in terms of being able to look at it on a screen or a phone and making sure all elements respond appropriately to the interface.  I'm not sure about the other two but will soon find out!

  Researched answer: The three components of responsive design include: 1) Flexible Layouts - using a flexible grid to create the website adn layout that will dynamiccaly resize to any width.  2) Media Queries - an extension to media types when targeting and including styles.  Allow designers to specify different styles for specfiic browser and device circumstances. 3) Flexible Media - media is scalable and is able to change the size of the media as the size of the viewport changes.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming - based on the concept of objects, which can contain data, in the form of fields and code in the form of prodcedure. The four pillars are: 1) Abstraction- wrapping up complex actions in simple verbs. 2) Encapsulation - keep state and logic internal. 3)  Inheritance - classes have parent classes adn those parent classes have child classes that will inherit all of the behavior and attribute of the parent class.  Child classes can also overwrite some of those as necessary. 4) Polymorphism - we can call the same method on different objects.
- irb- known as Interactive Ruby, is a quick way to explore the Ruby programming language adn try out code without creating a file.  It is a Read-Eval-Print Loop or REPL tool offered by many modern programming languages.  It evaluates teh code you type and displays the results.
- Instance variable- a varaible that is accessible in any instance method in a particular instance of a class.
- Ruby hash- can be used to store other objects.  Unlike arrays, which are like lists, hashes are like dictionaries.  You can use them to look up one thing by another thing.  It assigns values to keys so that the values can be looked up by their key.
- Class relationships- there are three important relatinoships in Ruby known as "belongs to..," , "has many...", and "has many of each other."  If a class "belongs to" another, it will have the name of the class that it belongs to listed under attr_accessor.  Then set the writer method to equal an instance of the class it belongs to.  If a class "has many" of another, it will have an array of the second class in its initialize method.  "Has many of each other" draws from the above two relationships.  Both of the previous programatic language has to be built into both classes.
- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby- Getter methods are used to get the value of an instance variable while the setter methods are used to set the value of an instance variable of some class.
